# .NET 5 Product Roadmap

This document provides a peek into the work we've planned for .NET through December 2020.

The .NET product roadmap communicates project priorities for evolving and extending the scope of the product. New product experiences and features will include changes in various [layers of the product](../Documentation/core-repos.md), in some combination of the runtime, framework, language compilers and tools. Each component may have its own component-level roadmap that is available in the repository for that component.

Items in each section are sorted by current status and include the following icons:

- No icon - Planned
- ![In Progress](media/in-progress.png "In Progress icon") - In Progress
- ![Completed](media/completed.png "Completed icon") - Completed
